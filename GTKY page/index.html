         <p>Hello! I am a Cyber Security Major with a Computer Programming Minor. 
            I really enjoy being active and playing sports! My favorite sport is soccer! 
            I am excited for this class to learn more about web design and how websites actually work run. 
            I think understanding web development will help me with the security side of things as well. 
            I have been a member of the Church for my whole live and worked on continued conversion throughout my life
            and my mission to Michigan and Ohio helped establish and boost my testimony. 
            One of my favorite scriptures is Alma 37:6.
